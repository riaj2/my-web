                <P>We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked, and homeless. The poverty of being
                    unwanted, unloved, and uncared for is the greatest poverty. </P>

                only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time, we can give our expertise, we can give our love,
                or simply give a smile. What does that cost? The point is, none of us can ever run out of something
                worthwhile to give.
